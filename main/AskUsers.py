# # To Do:
# # Add a new functionality in Lary 🐟 so that i can take any number from the user and add 100 to the number entered by the user and show him the new number.

# lry_num=int(input("Hello Lary! please enter any number and I can show you 100 more in that number: "))
# print(f"Thanks, you entered {lry_num}, and 100 more of it is: {(lry_num+100)}")

# # calculating the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2*(length + width))

# rect_l =int(input("Hello! please enter length of rectangle: "))
# rect_w =int(input("Please enter width of rectangle: "))
# print(f"Perimeter of a rectangle with length: {rect_l} and width: {rect_w} is : {2*(rect_l + rect_w)}")


# take length and width from user as input
# calcualting the volume of a sphere (Volume = (4/3)pi * (r^3))
pi=3.14
sphere_r =int(input("Hello! please enter radious of sphere: "))

print(f"Volume of a sphere with radius: {sphere_r} is : {((4/3)*pi) * (sphere_r**3)}")

# take radius from user as input
# save pi = 3.14
# for converting input to integer or decimal point number user int() or float()
